Cookie and Rock

**Still under construction!!!**
Check it out at [cookieandrock.dev](https://cookieandrock.dev).

## About

Cookie and Rock is a small project I'm working on as a way to group together
many smaller projects. Sometimes there are small projects that require a
server, webserver/interface, or database; making Cookie and Rock will help
group up all these services and projects together.

## Credits

(Until I come up with a better way to add credits) I'd like to give credit to
those who contributed.

-   Michael Leonffu: Full-Stack.
-   Yun Chiang: Co-foundered the design concept of *Cookie and Rock*.
-   Anna Li: images/logos/icons.
-   Astrid Leonffu: Web design.
-   Friends: motivation, inspiration, feedback and support.

## Services/Projects

So far there is only the Website/Interface framework. Later I hope to integrate
more features. The API is a given but first comes the front end.

Eventually I would like to add something for my
[sourdough starter](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe).
