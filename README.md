Cookie and Rock

**Still under construction!!!**
Check it out at [cookieandrock.dev](https://cookieandrock.dev).

## About

Cookie and Rock is a small project I'm working on as a way to group together
many smaller projects. Sometimes there are small projects that require a
server, webserver/interface, or database; making Cookie and Rock will help
group up all these services and projects together.

Also I can make a portfolio!

## Services/Projects

So far there is only the Website/Interface framework. Later I hope to integrate
more features. The API is a given but first comes the front end.

Eventually I would like to add something for my
[sourdough starter](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe).

-   [ ] Move posts into private CMS as well.
-   [ ] Fix links and relative/absolute references.
