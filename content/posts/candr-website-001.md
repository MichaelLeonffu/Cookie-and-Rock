# CandR-website: 001 "Website from scratch"

*By Michael Leonffu, March 23, 2021 23:40*

Making a blog-website from scratch. Ideally not paying for anything.

- [Tools](#tools)
- [Installation](#installation)
- [See also](#see-also)

## Stack

With advice from Cameron, a front end guy, I'm making this stack:

-   Next.js: webserver
-   Vercel: hosting
-   ubuntu: server
-   github: version control
-   npm: package manager
-   Google Style Guide:
-   Markdown:

## Tools

-   Terminal
-   Vscode
    -   Auto port forwarding so cool!
    -   git integration

## Installation

**git**:

    git init

also:

    wget -c https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Node.gitignore -O .gitignore



**Next.js**:

Installing this by following the manual section of
[Next.js guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started#manual-setup).

https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving


I wanted to make some sort of guide to follow but I'm really just reading
and learning from the docs. So there isn't much to do here other than
talk about the choices of software and how they work together.
